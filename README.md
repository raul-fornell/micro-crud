# micro-crud

Micro CRUD to manage Pokemon made with a PHP backend API and a Svelte frontend. Just for fun, don't use it in production! Instead of a database it uses a simple txt and nothing is sanitized.

## Requirements

PHP 8 and HTTP server.

## Start server

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:9000 -t server
```

## Start client

In frontend folder, run

```bash
npm run dev
```
